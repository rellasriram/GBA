There is an invisible cow somewhere on the screen, your job is to find it!

Pressing on the enter (return) button on the start_screen will start the game
Pressing the backspace (delete) button will return to the start_screen at any point of the game

Use the up, down, left and right arrow keys to control the finder (pointer)

The step counter will count the number of steps you take to find the cow. If your steps exceed or equal 500, you lose

But If the pointer touches the invisible cow (located somewhere on the screen) and your steps are less than 500, you win
